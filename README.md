## About

A lightweight minimalistic theme written in vanilla JSON. It is unfortunately not powered by AI.

This color theme quite literally only has like four colors, so if you are trying to show off your LGBTQ pride on your text editor, you are probably better off with Catpoopchin or Tokyo Ghoul or something.

## Native Language Support

English, Python and JSON

What about Rust and other epic gamer languages? - Not supported yet since I don't code in those epic gamer languages.

## Contribution

Contributions are not welcome. Fuck You. Go fork and create your own theme or something. This shit is mine bruh.
